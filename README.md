First: Hello!
Second: Why are you here?
Third: This is not a serious project, go elsewhere.
4. If you run fernet_key on your computer, generate a key. Save your key locally, it is mostly for fun.
5. Now you can use Meek client to write notes.
6. You can use n√≤ph client to write long blogs and CMS, to write replies and edits, probably none of this can work without imagination.
7. Alpha test and beta test, they are reading client and reaction client respectively.
8. Alake is the client to read notes, you can also reply, but with a random key.
9. Web bookmark, select the link with Note_link and save to a labeled file. Speed_link bookmarks the link with some tags. Search_tag_link searches for other speed links published on the net.
10. The project mainly uses a library called nostr-sdk (rust-nostr). So you can consult it if you are looking for something useful.
